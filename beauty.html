        <p>"Beauty is the ideal mean between, on the one hand, unity and diversity and, on the other hand, simplicity and complexity...
          It is this insight which has guided my own attempt to develop a process ethic, which takes as our most basic concern the
          obligation always to act in such a way as to bring about the greatest degree of beauty and value which in each situation is possible"

          Everything outside "beautiful" circle has its own beauty, its own value, depending on the subject and context.
          ie: sublime beauty (tian men dong), commonplace beauty (pigeons at a BART station), ridiculous beauty (reality TV like kardashians or telenovelas),
          tragic beauty (the eyes of a dying animal), ugly beauty (the grosteque).
